# power_rangers_nlp
"*learning nlp with the most formulaic possible text*"

The idea here is that we will scrape episode synopsis' for power rangers, a show whos episodes are basically all the same anyways. we will then look to prehaps classify the theme of the episode into one of a few groups, before attempting to generate fake episodes of our own.
