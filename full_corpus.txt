their control, to battle turbanshell. however the fight goes even worse than before as turbanshell unleashes a full assault on the megazord causing massive damage. turbanshell then withdraws into his shell and uses it to ram the thunder megazord directly, which causes the rangers except for red ranger to eject and the zords to forcibly separate leaving just the red dragon thunderzord. it attempts to battle itself, but is defeated just as quickly and forced back into its dragon mode. just as green ranger is about to summon dragonzord, zordon contacts him and explains that turbanshell needs to be attacked from within with heat, then cold from the outside. green ranger hides in a crate of watermelons which turbanshell spots and, becoming hungry, eats. green ranger then begins firing a laser provided by blue ranger within turbanshell's stomach. with green ranger doing his part, black ranger picks up a fire hose and starts firing cold water at turbanshell chilling the monster from outside.

center, zordon congratulatesgreen ranger on a job well done. the rangers thankgreen ranger and tell him he's a true hero. green ranger explains them he was about give up but then he realized it wasn't

be in his heart. the teens place their hands in the center, for one last time, and then leap into the air, shouting power rangers.
